EventLoop:
- JavaScript is a single threaded language, it has 1 callstack which performance single task at a time.
- In order to perfomance asyncronous tasks in Javascript, EventLoop plays an important role between "callstack", "web APIs" and "eventqueue".
- Eventloop continuously montiors the "callstack" and the moment "callstack" is empty, Eventloop start poping functions from "eventqueue" and pushes into the callstack for execution.
- There are 2 types of eventqueues in JavaScript: Microtask queue and Macrotask queue.
- Microtask queue has higher priority over macrotask queue and it is used to handle promises whereas macrotask queue is used to handle operations like setTimeout, setInterval.
