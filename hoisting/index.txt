Hoisting:
- Hoisting is a mechanism in JavaScript where all the variables and functions are moved at the top of their lexical scope.
- variables declared with "var" keywords can be used before their declartion because of hoisting.
- "let" and "const" don't hoist and if variables are used without declartion, JavaScript throws a reference error.
