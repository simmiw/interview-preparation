Closure:
- Function inside a function is called closure.
- In closure property inner function has access of variables of outer function.
- In ideal case scenario, variables are vaished from the memory after their execution.
- However in the case of closure, variables are stored in the head memory beacause they can be accessed by inner function.
- Closure are one of the example of memory leak in the JavaScript.
