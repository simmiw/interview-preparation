- Every function in JavaScript has a property called prototype, this is a common property across objects.
- prototype is an object where it is associated with the function by default, can be accessed, modifies &
    create a new variables and methods to it, share across all the instances of its constructor function.
- when we need to share some functionality(variables or methods) at a later stage and needs sharing across 
    all instance then the prototype comes handy.
