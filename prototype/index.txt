- Every constructor function in JavaScript has a property called prototype, this is a common property across objects.
- prototype is an object where it is associated with the function by default, can be accessed, modifies &
    create a new variables and methods to it, share across all the instances of its constructor function.
- when we need to share some functionality(variables or methods) at a later stage and needs sharing across 
    all instance then the prototype comes handy.

    function abc (){
        this.name: "ben"
        this.age: 34
    }

    const person = new abc();
    //person is an instanc of abc(), however it is not a constructor so further instances of 
    //person can be created using new keyword.
    object has property called .__proto and fucntions has prototype: under the hood they both points to the same property.
 abc.prototype=== person.__proto // true
