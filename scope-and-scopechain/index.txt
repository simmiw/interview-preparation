Scope and Scope Chain:
- Scope let us know which are the varaibles and functions are accessible.
- There are 3 scopes in JavaScript
    1. Global scope: Varibales and fnctions declared in globalnamespace have global scope and can be accessed from anywhere within the code.
    2. Function scope: Variables and functions are declared inside functions have function scope which means they can be accessed within that function.
    3. Block scope: Variables declared using let and const keywords have block scope. These varaibles can only be accessed inside a block {}.
- JavaScript also uses scope to find variables. If JavaScript doesn't find a particluar variable in the local scope.
  It tries to find it in the outer scope and if it doesn't exist in the outer scope. It tries to find it in the global scope.
  If it doesn't exist there browser throws a reference error. This process is called Scope chain.
