this-keyword:
- "this" keyword always refers to an object which is currently calling the function.
- When we call a function as a method of object, "this" keywords refers to the calling object.
- When "this" keyword is used in global scope(non-strict mode), it refers to window object.
- When we bind "this" keyword using call, bind and apply method.
- Arrow function doesn't have thier own "this" value therefore they take "this" vale from their lexical scope.
